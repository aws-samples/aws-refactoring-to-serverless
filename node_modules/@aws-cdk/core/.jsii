It defines the core classes that are used in the rest of the\nAWS Construct Library.\n\nSee the [AWS CDK Developer\nGuide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) for\ninformation of most of the capabilities of this library. The rest of this\nREADME will only cover topics not already covered in the Developer Guide.\n\n<!--BEGIN CORE DOCUMENTATION-->\n\n## Stacks and Stages\n\nA `Stack` is the smallest physical unit of deployment, and maps directly onto\na CloudFormation Stack. You define a Stack by defining a subclass of `Stack`\n-- let's call it `MyStack` -- and instantiating the constructs that make up\nyour application in `MyStack`'s constructor. You then instantiate this stack\none or more times to define different instances of your application. For example,\nyou can instantiate it once using few and cheap EC2 instances for testing,\nand once again using more and bigger EC2 instances for production.\n\nWhen your application grows, you may decide that it makes more sense to split it\nout across multiple `Stack` classes. This can happen for a number of reasons:\n\n- You could be starting to reach the maximum number of resources allowed in a single\n  stack (this is currently 500).\n- You could decide you want to separate out stateful resources and stateless resources\n  into separate stacks, so that it becomes easy to tear down and recreate the stacks\n  that don't have stateful resources.\n- There could be a single stack with resources (like a VPC) that are shared\n  between multiple instances of other stacks containing your applications.\n\nAs soon as your conceptual application starts to encompass multiple stacks,\nit is convenient to wrap them in another construct that represents your\nlogical application. You can then treat that new unit the same way you used\nto be able to treat a single stack: by instantiating it multiple times\nfor different instances of your application.\n\nYou can define a custom subclass of `Stage`, holding one or more\n`Stack`s, to represent a single logical instance of your application.\n\nAs a final note: `Stack`s are not a unit of reuse. They describe physical\ndeployment layouts, and as such are best left to application builders to\norganize their deployments with. If you want to vend a reusable construct,\ndefine it as a subclasses of `Construct`: the consumers of your construct\nwill decide where to place it in their own stacks.\n\n## Stack Synthesizers\n\nEach Stack has a *synthesizer*, an object that determines how and where\nthe Stack should be synthesized and deployed. The synthesizer controls\naspects like:\n\n- How does the stack reference assets? (Either through CloudFormation\n  parameters the CLI supplies, or because the Stack knows a predefined\n  location where assets will be uploaded).\n- What roles are used to deploy the stack? These can be bootstrapped\n  roles, roles created in some other way, or just the CLI's current\n  credentials.\n\nThe following synthesizers are available:\n\n- `DefaultStackSynthesizer`: recommended. Uses predefined asset locations and\n  roles created by the modern bootstrap template. Access control is done by\n  controlling who can assume the deploy role. This is the default stack\n  synthesizer in CDKv2.\n- `LegacyStackSynthesizer`: Uses CloudFormation parameters to communicate\n  asset locations, and the CLI's current permissions to deploy stacks. The\n  is the default stack synthesizer in CDKv1.\n- `CliCredentialsStackSynthesizer`: Uses predefined asset locations, and the\n  CLI's current permissions.\n\nEach of these synthesizers takes configuration arguments. To configure\na stack with a synthesizer, pass it as one of its properties:\n\n```ts\nnew MyStack(app, 'MyStack', {\n  synthesizer: new DefaultStackSynthesizer({\n    fileAssetsBucketName: 'my-orgs-asset-bucket',\n  }),\n});\n```\n\nFor more information on bootstrapping accounts and customizing synthesis,\nsee [Bootstrapping in the CDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html).\n\n## Nested Stacks\n\n[Nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html) are stacks created as part of other stacks. You create a nested stack within another stack by using the `NestedStack` construct.\n\nAs your infrastructure grows, common patterns can emerge in which you declare the same components in multiple templates. You can separate out these common components and create dedicated templates for them. Then use the resource in your template to reference other templates, creating nested stacks.\n\nFor example, assume that you have a load balancer configuration that you use for most of your stacks. Instead of copying and pasting the same configurations into your templates, you can create a dedicated template for the load balancer. Then, you just use the resource to reference that template from within other templates.\n\nThe following example will define a single top-level stack that contains two nested stacks: each one with a single Amazon S3 bucket:\n\n```ts\nclass MyNestedStack extends cfn.NestedStack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cfn.NestedStackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    new s3.Bucket(this, 'NestedBucket');\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyParentStack extends Stack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    new MyNestedStack(this, 'Nested1');\n    new MyNestedStack(this, 'Nested2');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResources references across nested/parent boundaries (even with multiple levels of nesting) will be wired by the AWS CDK\nthrough CloudFormation parameters and outputs. When a resource from a parent stack is referenced by a nested stack,\na CloudFormation parameter will automatically be added to the nested stack and assigned from the parent; when a resource\nfrom a nested stack is referenced by a parent stack, a CloudFormation output will be automatically be added to the\nnested stack and referenced using `Fn::GetAtt \"Outputs.Xxx\"` from the parent.\n\nNested stacks also support the use of Docker image and file assets.\n\n## Accessing resources in a different stack\n\nYou can access resources in a different stack, as long as they are in the\nsame account and AWS Region. The following example defines the stack `stack1`,\nwhich defines an Amazon S3 bucket. Then it defines a second stack, `stack2`,\nwhich takes the bucket from stack1 as a constructor property.\n\n```ts\nconst prod = { account: '123456789012', region: 'us-east-1' };\n\nconst stack1 = new StackThatProvidesABucket(app, 'Stack1' , { env: prod });\n\n// stack2 will take a property { bucket: IBucket }\nconst stack2 = new StackThatExpectsABucket(app, 'Stack2', {\n  bucket: stack1.bucket,\n  env: prod\n});\n```\n\nIf the AWS CDK determines that the resource is in the same account and\nRegion, but in a different stack, it automatically synthesizes AWS\nCloudFormation\n[Exports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-exports.html)\nin the producing stack and an\n[Fn::ImportValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-importvalue.html)\nin the consuming stack to transfer that information from one stack to the\nother.\n\n### Removing automatic cross-stack references\n\nThe automatic references created by CDK when you use resources across stacks\nare convenient, but may block your deployments if you want to remove the\nresources that are referenced in this way. You will see an error like:\n\n```text\nExport Stack1:ExportsOutputFnGetAtt-****** cannot be deleted as it is in use by Stack1\n```\n\nLet's say there is a Bucket in the `stack1`, and the `stack2` references its\n`bucket.bucketName`. You now want to remove the bucket and run into the error above.\n\nIt's not safe to remove `stack1.bucket` while `stack2` is still using it, so\nunblocking yourself from this is a two-step process. This is how it works:\n\nDEPLOYMENT 1: break the relationship\n\n- Make sure `stack2` no longer references `bucket.bucketName` (maybe the consumer\n  stack now uses its own bucket, or it writes to an AWS DynamoDB table, or maybe you just\n  remove the Lambda Function altogether).\n- In the `stack1` class, call `this.exportValue(this.bucket.bucketName)`. This\n  will make sure the CloudFormation Export continues to exist while the relationship\n  between the two stacks is being broken.\n- Deploy (this will effectively only change the `stack2`, but it's safe to deploy both).\n\nDEPLOYMENT 2: remove the resource\n\n- You are now free to remove the `bucket` resource from `stack1`.\n- Don't forget to remove the `exportValue()` call as well.\n- Deploy again (this time only the `stack1` will be changed -- the bucket will be deleted).\n\n## Durations\n\nTo make specifications of time intervals unambiguous, a single class called\n`Duration` is used throughout the AWS Construct Library by all constructs\nthat that take a time interval as a parameter (be it for a timeout, a\nrate, or something else).\n\nAn instance of Duration is constructed by using one of the static factory\nmethods on it:\n\n```ts\nDuration.seconds(300)   // 5 minutes\nDuration.minutes(5)     // 5 minutes\nDuration.hours(1)       // 1 hour\nDuration.days(7)        // 7 days\nDuration.parse('PT5M')  // 5 minutes\n```\n\nDurations can be added or subtracted together:\n\n```ts\nDuration.minutes(1).plus(Duration.seconds(60)); // 2 minutes\nDuration.minutes(5).minus(Duration.seconds(10)); // 290 secondes\n```\n\n## Size (Digital Information Quantity)\n\nTo make specification of digital storage quantities unambiguous, a class called\n`Size` is available.\n\nAn instance of `Size` is initialized through one of its static factory methods:\n\n```ts\nSize.kibibytes(200) // 200 KiB\nSize.mebibytes(5)   // 5 MiB\nSize.gibibytes(40)  // 40 GiB\nSize.tebibytes(200) // 200 TiB\nSize.pebibytes(3)   // 3 PiB\n```\n\nInstances of `Size` created with one of the units can be converted into others.\nBy default, conversion to a higher unit will fail if the conversion does not produce\na whole number. This can be overridden by unsetting `integral` property.\n\n```ts\nSize.mebibytes(2).toKibibytes()                                             // yields 2048\nSize.kibibytes(2050).toMebibytes({ rounding: SizeRoundingBehavior.FLOOR })  // yields 2\n```\n\n## Secrets\n\nTo help avoid accidental storage of secrets as plain text, we use the `SecretValue` type to\nrepresent secrets. Any construct that takes a value that should be a secret (such as\na password or an access key) will take a parameter of type `SecretValue`.\n\nThe best practice is to store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager and reference them using `SecretValue.secretsManager`:\n\n```ts\nconst secret = SecretValue.secretsManager('secretId', {\n  jsonField: 'password', // optional: key of a JSON field to retrieve (defaults to all content),\n  versionId: 'id',       // optional: id of the version (default AWSCURRENT)\n  versionStage: 'stage', // optional: version stage name (default AWSCURRENT)\n});\n```\n\nUsing AWS Secrets Manager is the recommended way to reference secrets in a CDK app.\n`SecretValue` also supports the following secret sources:\n\n- `SecretValue.unsafePlainText(secret)`: stores the secret as plain text in your app and the resulting template (not recommended).\n- `SecretValue.secretsManager(secret)`: refers to a secret stored in Secrets Manager\n- `SecretValue.ssmSecure(param, version)`: refers to a secret stored as a SecureString in the SSM\n Parameter Store. If you don't specify the exact version, AWS CloudFormation uses the latest\n version of the parameter.\n- `SecretValue.cfnParameter(param)`: refers to a secret passed through a CloudFormation parameter (must have `NoEcho: true`).\n- `SecretValue.cfnDynamicReference(dynref)`: refers to a secret described by a CloudFormation dynamic reference (used by `ssmSecure` and `secretsManager`).\n- `SecretValue.resourceAttribute(attr)`: refers to a secret returned from a CloudFormation resource creation.\n\n`SecretValue`s should only be passed to constructs that accept properties of type\n`SecretValue`. These constructs are written to ensure your secrets will not be\nexposed where they shouldn't be. If you try to use a `SecretValue` in a\ndifferent location, an error about unsafe secret usage will be thrown at\nsynthesis time.\n\n## ARN manipulation\n\nSometimes you will need to put together or pick apart Amazon Resource Names\n(ARNs). The functions `stack.formatArn()` and `stack.parseArn()` exist for\nthis purpose.\n\n`formatArn()` can be used to build an ARN from components. It will automatically\nuse the region and account of the stack you're calling it on:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const stack: Stack;\n\n// Builds \"arn:<PARTITION>:lambda:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT>:function:MyFunction\"\nstack.formatArn({\n  service: 'lambda',\n  resource: 'function',\n  sep: ':',\n  resourceName: 'MyFunction'\n});\n```\n\n`parseArn()` can be used to get a single component from an ARN. `parseArn()`\nwill correctly deal with both literal ARNs and deploy-time values (tokens),\nbut in case of a deploy-time value be aware that the result will be another\ndeploy-time value which cannot be inspected in the CDK application.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const stack: Stack;\n\n// Extracts the function name out of an AWS Lambda Function ARN\nconst arnComponents = stack.parseArn(arn, ':');\nconst functionName = arnComponents.resourceName;\n```\n\nNote that depending on the service, the resource separator can be either\n`:` or `/`, and the resource name can be either the 6th or 7th\ncomponent in the ARN. When using these functions, you will need to know\nthe format of the ARN you are dealing with.\n\nFor an exhaustive list of ARN formats used in AWS, see [AWS ARNs and\nNamespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)\nin the AWS General Reference.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Construct Dependencies\n\nSometimes AWS resources depend on other resources, and the creation of one\nresource must be completed before the next one can be started.\n\nIn general, CloudFormation will correctly infer the dependency relationship\nbetween resources based on the property values that are used. In the cases where\nit doesn't, the AWS Construct Library will add the dependency relationship for\nyou.\n\nIf you need to add an ordering dependency that is not automatically inferred,\nyou do so by adding a dependency relationship using\n`constructA.node.addDependency(constructB)`. This will add a dependency\nrelationship between all resources in the scope of `constructA` and all\nresources in the scope of `constructB`.\n\nIf you want a single object to represent a set of constructs that are not\nnecessarily in the same scope, you can use a `ConcreteDependable`. The\nfollowing creates a single object that represents a dependency on two\nconstructs, `constructB` and `constructC`:\n\n```ts\n// Declare the dependable object\nconst bAndC = new ConcreteDependable();\nbAndC.add(constructB);\nbAndC.add(constructC);\n\n// Take the dependency\nconstructA.node.addDependency(bAndC);\n```\n\n### Stack Dependencies\n\nTwo different stack instances can have a dependency on one another. This\nhappens when an resource from one stack is referenced in another stack. In\nthat case, CDK records the cross-stack referencing of resources,\nautomatically produces the right CloudFormation primitives, and adds a\ndependency between the two stacks. You can also manually add a dependency\nbetween two stacks by using the `stackA.addDependency(stackB)` method.\n\nA stack dependency has the following implications:\n\n- Cyclic dependencies are not allowed, so if `stackA` is using resources from\n  `stackB`, the reverse is not possible anymore.\n- Stacks with dependencies between them are treated specially by the CDK\n  toolkit:\n  - If `stackA` depends on `stackB`, running `cdk deploy stackA` will also\n    automatically deploy `stackB`.\n  - `stackB`'s deployment will be performed *before* `stackA`'s deployment.\n\n## Custom Resources\n\nCustom Resources are CloudFormation resources that are implemented by arbitrary\nuser code. They can do arbitrary lookups or modifications during a\nCloudFormation deployment.\n\nTo define a custom resource, use the `CustomResource` construct:\n\n```ts\nnew CustomResource(this, 'MyMagicalResource', {\n  resourceType: 'Custom::MyCustomResource', // must start with 'Custom::'\n\n  // the resource properties\n  properties: {\n    Property1: 'foo',\n    Property2: 'bar'\n  },\n\n  // the ARN of the provider (SNS/Lambda) which handles\n  // CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE events for this resource type\n  // see next section for details\n  serviceToken: 'ARN'\n});\n```\n\n### Custom Resource Providers\n\nCustom resources are backed by a **custom resource provider** which can be\nimplemented in one of the following ways. The following table compares the\nvarious provider types (ordered from low-level to high-level):\n\n| Provider                                                             | Compute Type | Error Handling | Submit to CloudFormation | Max Timeout     | Language | Footprint |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------:|:---------------:|:--------:|:---------:|\n| [sns.Topic](#amazon-sns-topic)                                       | Self-managed | Manual         | Manual                   | Unlimited       | Any      | Depends   |\n| [lambda.Function](#aws-lambda-function)                              | AWS Lambda   | Manual         | Manual                   | 15min           | Any      | Small     |\n| [core.CustomResourceProvider](#the-corecustomresourceprovider-class) | Lambda       | Auto           | Auto                     | 15min           | Node.js  | Small     |\n| [custom-resources.Provider](#the-custom-resource-provider-framework) | Lambda       | Auto           | Auto                     | Unlimited Async | Any      | Large     |\n\nLegend:\n\n- **Compute type**: which type of compute can is used to execute the handler.\n- **Error Handling**: whether errors thrown by handler code are automatically\n  trapped and a FAILED response is submitted to CloudFormation. If this is\n  \"Manual\", developers must take care of trapping errors. Otherwise, events\n  could cause stacks to hang.\n- **Submit to CloudFormation**: whether the framework takes care of submitting\n  SUCCESS/FAILED responses to CloudFormation through the event's response URL.\n- **Max Timeout**: maximum allows/possible timeout.\n- **Language**: which programming languages can be used to implement handlers.\n- **Footprint**: how many resources are used by the provider framework itself.\n\n**A NOTE ABOUT SINGLETONS**\n\nWhen defining resources for a custom resource provider, you will likely want to\ndefine them as a *stack singleton* so that only a single instance of the\nprovider is created in your stack and which is used by all custom resources of\nthat type.\n\nHere is a basic pattern for defining stack singletons in the CDK. The following\nexamples ensures that only a single SNS topic is defined:\n\n```ts\nfunction getOrCreate(scope: Construct): sns.Topic {\n  const stack = Stack.of(scope);\n  const uniqueid = 'GloballyUniqueIdForSingleton'; // For example, a UUID from `uuidgen`\n  const existing = stack.node.tryFindChild(uniqueid);\n  if (existing) {\n    return existing as sns.Topic;\n  }\n  return new sns.Topic(stack, uniqueid);\n}\n```\n\n#### Amazon SNS Topic\n\nEvery time a resource event occurs (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE), an SNS notification\nis sent to the SNS topic. Users must process these notifications (e.g. through a\nfleet of worker hosts) and submit success/failure responses to the\nCloudFormation service.\n\nSet `serviceToken` to `topic.topicArn`  in order to use this provider:\n\n```ts\nconst topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'MyProvider');\n\nnew CustomResource(this, 'MyResource', {\n  serviceToken: topic.topicArn\n});\n```\n\n#### AWS Lambda Function\n\nAn AWS lambda function is called *directly* by CloudFormation for all resource\nevents. The handler must take care of explicitly submitting a success/failure\nresponse to the CloudFormation service and handle various error cases.\n\nSet `serviceToken` to `lambda.functionArn` to use this provider:\n\n```ts\nconst fn = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyProvider', functionProps);\n\nnew CustomResource(this, 'MyResource', {\n  serviceToken: fn.functionArn,\n});\n```\n\n#### The `core.CustomResourceProvider` class\n\nThe class [`@aws-cdk/core.CustomResourceProvider`] offers a basic low-level\nframework designed to implement simple and slim custom resource providers. It\ncurrently only supports Node.js-based user handlers, and it does not have\nsupport for asynchronous waiting (handler cannot exceed the 15min lambda\ntimeout).\n\n[`@aws-cdk/core.CustomResourceProvider`]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_core.CustomResourceProvider.html\n\nThe provider has a built-in singleton method which uses the resource type as a\nstack-unique identifier and returns the service token:\n\n```ts\nconst serviceToken = CustomResourceProvider.getOrCreate(this, 'Custom::MyCustomResourceType', {\n  codeDirectory: `${__dirname}/my-handler`,\n  runtime: CustomResourceProviderRuntime.NODEJS_12_X,\n  description: \"Lambda function created by the custom resource provider\",\n});\n\nnew CustomResource(this, 'MyResource', {\n  resourceType: 'Custom::MyCustomResourceType',\n  serviceToken: serviceToken\n});\n```\n\nThe directory (`my-handler` in the above example) must include an `index.js` file. It cannot import\nexternal dependencies or files outside this directory. It must export an async\nfunction named `handler`. This function accepts the CloudFormation resource\nevent object and returns an object with the following structure:\n\n```js\nexports.handler = async function(event) {\n  const id = event.PhysicalResourceId; // only for \"Update\" and \"Delete\"\n  const props = event.ResourceProperties;\n  const oldProps = event.OldResourceProperties; // only for \"Update\"s\n\n  switch (event.RequestType) {\n    case \"Create\":\n      // ...\n\n    case \"Update\":\n      // ...\n\n      // if an error is thrown, a FAILED response will be submitted to CFN\n      throw new Error('Failed!');\n\n    case \"Delete\":\n      // ...\n  }\n\n  return {\n    // (optional) the value resolved from `resource.ref`\n    // defaults to \"event.PhysicalResourceId\" or \"event.RequestId\"\n    PhysicalResourceId: \"REF\",\n\n    // (optional) calling `resource.getAtt(\"Att1\")` on the custom resource in the CDK app\n    // will return the value \"BAR\".\n    Data: {\n      Att1: \"BAR\",\n      Att2: \"BAZ\"\n    },\n\n    // (optional) user-visible message\n    Reason: \"User-visible message\",\n\n    // (optional) hides values from the console\n    NoEcho: true\n  };\n}\n```\n\nHere is an complete example of a custom resource that summarizes two numbers:\n\n`sum-handler/index.js`:\n\n```js\nexports.handler = async (e) => {\n  return {\n    Data: {\n      Result: e.ResourceProperties.lhs + e.ResourceProperties.rhs,\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\n`sum.ts`:\n\n```ts nofixture\nimport {\n  Construct,\n  CustomResource,\n  CustomResourceProvider,\n  CustomResourceProviderRuntime,\n  Token,\n} from '@aws-cdk/core';\n\nexport interface SumProps {\n  readonly lhs: number;\n  readonly rhs: number;\n}\n\nexport class Sum extends Construct {\n  public readonly result: number;\n\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: SumProps) {\n    super(scope, id);\n\n    const resourceType = 'Custom::Sum';\n    const serviceToken = CustomResourceProvider.getOrCreate(this, resourceType, {\n      codeDirectory: `${__dirname}/sum-handler`,\n      runtime: CustomResourceProviderRuntime.NODEJS_12_X,\n    });\n\n    const resource = new CustomResource(this, 'Resource', {\n      resourceType: resourceType,\n      serviceToken: serviceToken,\n      properties: {\n        lhs: props.lhs,\n        rhs: props.rhs\n      }\n    });\n\n    this.result = Token.asNumber(resource.getAtt('Result'));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsage will look like this:\n\n```ts fixture=README-custom-resource-provider\nconst sum = new Sum(this, 'MySum', { lhs: 40, rhs: 2 });\nnew CfnOutput(this, 'Result', { value: Token.asString(sum.result) });\n```\n\nTo access the ARN of the provider's AWS Lambda function role, use the `getOrCreateProvider()`\nbuilt-in singleton method:\n\n```ts\nconst provider = CustomResourceProvider.getOrCreateProvider(this, 'Custom::MyCustomResourceType', {\n  codeDirectory: `${__dirname}/my-handler`,\n  runtime: CustomResourceProviderRuntime.NODEJS_12_X,\n});\n\nconst roleArn = provider.roleArn;\n```\n\nThis role ARN can then be used in resource-based IAM policies.\n\n#### The Custom Resource Provider Framework\n\nThe [`@aws-cdk/custom-resources`] module includes an advanced framework for\nimplementing custom resource providers.\n\n[`@aws-cdk/custom-resources`]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/custom-resources-readme.html\n\nHandlers are implemented as AWS Lambda functions, which means that they can be\nimplemented in any Lambda-supported runtime. Furthermore, this provider has an\nasynchronous mode, which means that users can provide an `isComplete` lambda\nfunction which is called periodically until the operation is complete. This\nallows implementing providers that can take up to two hours to stabilize.\n\nSet `serviceToken` to `provider.serviceToken` to use this type of provider:\n\n```ts\nconst provider = new customresources.Provider(this, 'MyProvider', {\n  onEventHandler,\n  isCompleteHandler, // optional async waiter\n});\n\nnew CustomResource(this, 'MyResource', {\n  serviceToken: provider.serviceToken\n});\n```\n\nSee the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/custom-resources-readme.html) for more details.\n\n## AWS CloudFormation features\n\nA CDK stack synthesizes to an AWS CloudFormation Template. This section\nexplains how this module allows users to access low-level CloudFormation\nfeatures when needed.\n\n### Stack Outputs\n\nCloudFormation [stack outputs][cfn-stack-output] and exports are created using\nthe `CfnOutput` class:\n\n```ts\nnew CfnOutput(this, 'OutputName', {\n  value: myBucket.bucketName,\n  description: 'The name of an S3 bucket', // Optional\n  exportName: 'TheAwesomeBucket', // Registers a CloudFormation export named \"TheAwesomeBucket\"\n});\n```\n\n[cfn-stack-output]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html\n\n### Parameters\n\nCloudFormation templates support the use of [Parameters][cfn-parameters] to\ncustomize a template. They enable CloudFormation users to input custom values to\na template each time a stack is created or updated. While the CDK design\nphilosophy favors using build-time parameterization, users may need to use\nCloudFormation in a number of cases (for example, when migrating an existing\nstack to the AWS CDK).\n\nTemplate parameters can be added to a stack by using the `CfnParameter` class:\n\n```ts\nnew CfnParameter(this, 'MyParameter', {\n  type: 'Number',\n  default: 1337,\n  // See the API reference for more configuration props\n});\n```\n\nThe value of parameters can then be obtained using one of the `value` methods.\nAs parameters are only resolved at deployment time, the values obtained are\nplaceholder tokens for the real value (`Token.isUnresolved()` would return `true`\nfor those):\n\n```ts\nconst param = new CfnParameter(this, 'ParameterName', { /* config */ });\n\n// If the parameter is a String\nparam.valueAsString;\n\n// If the parameter is a Number\nparam.valueAsNumber;\n\n// If the parameter is a List\nparam.valueAsList;\n```\n\n[cfn-parameters]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html\n\n### Pseudo Parameters\n\nCloudFormation supports a number of [pseudo parameters][cfn-pseudo-params],\nwhich resolve to useful values at deployment time. CloudFormation pseudo\nparameters can be obtained from static members of the `Aws` class.\n\nIt is generally recommended to access pseudo parameters from the scope's `stack`\ninstead, which guarantees the values produced are qualifying the designated\nstack, which is essential in cases where resources are shared cross-stack:\n\n```ts\n// \"this\" is the current construct\nconst stack = Stack.of(this);\n\nstack.account; // Returns the AWS::AccountId for this stack (or the literal value if known)\nstack.region;  // Returns the AWS::Region for this stack (or the literal value if known)\nstack.partition;\n```\n\n[cfn-pseudo-params]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html\n\n### Resource Options\n\nCloudFormation resources can also specify [resource\nattributes][cfn-resource-attributes]. The `CfnResource` class allows\naccessing those through the `cfnOptions` property:\n\n```ts\nconst rawBucket = new s3.CfnBucket(this, 'Bucket', { /* ... */ });\n// -or-\nconst rawBucketAlt = myBucket.node.defaultChild as s3.CfnBucket;\n\n// then\nrawBucket.cfnOptions.condition = new CfnCondition(this, 'EnableBucket', { /* ... */ });\nrawBucket.cfnOptions.metadata = {\n  metadataKey: 'MetadataValue',\n};\n```\n\nResource dependencies (the `DependsOn` attribute) is modified using the\n`cfnResource.addDependsOn` method:\n\n```ts\nconst resourceA = new CfnResource(this, 'ResourceA', resourceProps);\nconst resourceB = new CfnResource(this, 'ResourceB', resourceProps);\n\nresourceB.addDependsOn(resourceA);\n```\n\n[cfn-resource-attributes]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-product-attribute-reference.html\n\n### Intrinsic Functions and Condition Expressions\n\nCloudFormation supports [intrinsic functions][cfn-intrinsics]. These functions\ncan be accessed from the `Fn` class, which provides type-safe methods for each\nintrinsic function as well as condition expressions:\n\n```ts\n// To use Fn::Base64\nFn.base64('SGVsbG8gQ0RLIQo=');\n\n// To compose condition expressions:\nconst environmentParameter = new CfnParameter(this, 'Environment');\nFn.conditionAnd(\n  // The \"Environment\" CloudFormation template parameter evaluates to \"Production\"\n  Fn.conditionEquals('Production', environmentParameter),\n  // The AWS::Region pseudo-parameter value is NOT equal to \"us-east-1\"\n  Fn.conditionNot(Fn.conditionEquals('us-east-1', Aws.REGION)),\n);\n```\n\nWhen working with deploy-time values (those for which `Token.isUnresolved`\nreturns `true`), idiomatic conditionals from the programming language cannot be\nused (the value will not be known until deployment time). When conditional logic\nneeds to be expressed with un-resolved values, it is necessary to use\nCloudFormation conditions by means of the `CfnCondition` class:\n\n```ts\nconst environmentParameter = new CfnParameter(this, 'Environment');\nconst isProd = new CfnCondition(this, 'IsProduction', {\n  expression: Fn.conditionEquals('Production', environmentParameter),\n});\n\n// Configuration value that is a different string based on IsProduction\nconst stage = Fn.conditionIf(isProd.logicalId, 'Beta', 'Prod').toString();\n\n// Make Bucket creation condition to IsProduction by accessing\n// and overriding the CloudFormation resource\nconst bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'Bucket');\nconst cfnBucket = myBucket.node.defaultChild as s3.CfnBucket;\ncfnBucket.cfnOptions.condition = isProd;\n```\n\n[cfn-intrinsics]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference.html\n\n### Mappings\n\nCloudFormation [mappings][cfn-mappings] are created and queried using the\n`CfnMappings` class:\n\n```ts\nconst regionTable = new CfnMapping(this, 'RegionTable', {\n  mapping: {\n    'us-east-1': {\n      regionName: 'US East (N. Virginia)',\n      // ...\n    },\n    'us-east-2': {\n      regionName: 'US East (Ohio)',\n      // ...\n    },\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n\nregionTable.findInMap(Aws.REGION, 'regionName')\n```\n\nThis will yield the following template:\n\n```yaml\nMappings:\n  RegionTable:\n    us-east-1:\n      regionName: US East (N. Virginia)\n    us-east-2:\n      regionName: US East (Ohio)\n```\n\nMappings can also be synthesized \"lazily\"; lazy mappings will only render a \"Mappings\"\nsection in the synthesized CloudFormation template if some `findInMap` call is unable to\nimmediately return a concrete value due to one or both of the keys being unresolved tokens\n(some value only available at deploy-time).\n\nFor example, the following code will not produce anything in the \"Mappings\" section. The\ncall to `findInMap` will be able to resolve the value during synthesis and simply return\n`'US East (Ohio)'`.\n\n```ts\nconst regionTable = new CfnMapping(this, 'RegionTable', {\n  mapping: {\n    'us-east-1': {\n      regionName: 'US East (N. Virginia)',\n    },\n    'us-east-2': {\n      regionName: 'US East (Ohio)',\n    },\n  },\n  lazy: true,\n});\n\nregionTable.findInMap('us-east-2', 'regionName');\n```\n\nOn the other hand, the following code will produce the \"Mappings\" section shown above,\nsince the top-level key is an unresolved token. The call to `findInMap` will return a token that resolves to\n`{ \"Fn::FindInMap\": [ \"RegionTable\", { \"Ref\": \"AWS::Region\" }, \"regionName\" ] }`.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const regionTable: CfnMapping;\n\nregionTable.findInMap(Aws.REGION, 'regionName');\n```\n\n[cfn-mappings]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/mappings-section-structure.html\n\n### Dynamic References\n\nCloudFormation supports [dynamically resolving][cfn-dynamic-references] values\nfor SSM parameters (including secure strings) and Secrets Manager. Encoding such\nreferences is done using the `CfnDynamicReference` class:\n\n```ts\nnew CfnDynamicReference(\n  CfnDynamicReferenceService.SECRETS_MANAGER,\n  'secret-id:secret-string:json-key:version-stage:version-id',\n);\n```\n\n[cfn-dynamic-references]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/dynamic-references.html\n\n### Template Options & Transform\n\nCloudFormation templates support a number of options, including which Macros or\n[Transforms][cfn-transform] to use when deploying the stack. Those can be\nconfigured using the `stack.templateOptions` property:\n\n```ts\nconst stack = new Stack(app, 'StackName');\n\nstack.templateOptions.description = 'This will appear in the AWS console';\nstack.templateOptions.transforms = ['AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'];\nstack.templateOptions.metadata = {\n  metadataKey: 'MetadataValue',\n};\n```\n\n[cfn-transform]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-section-structure.html\n\n### Emitting Raw Resources\n\nThe `CfnResource` class allows emitting arbitrary entries in the\n[Resources][cfn-resources] section of the CloudFormation template.\n\n```ts\nnew CfnResource(this, 'ResourceId', {\n  type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket',\n  properties: {\n    BucketName: 'bucket-name'\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAs for any other resource, the logical ID in the CloudFormation template will be\ngenerated by the AWS CDK, but the type and properties will be copied verbatim in\nthe synthesized template.\n\n[cfn-resources]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html\n\n### Including raw CloudFormation template fragments\n\nWhen migrating a CloudFormation stack to the AWS CDK, it can be useful to\ninclude fragments of an existing template verbatim in the synthesized template.\nThis can be achieved using the `CfnInclude` class.\n\n```ts\nnew CfnInclude(this, 'ID', {\n  template: {\n    Resources: {\n      Bucket: {\n        Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket',\n        Properties: {\n          BucketName: 'my-shiny-bucket'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Termination Protection\n\nYou can prevent a stack from being accidentally deleted by enabling termination\nprotection on the stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination\nprotection enabled, the deletion fails and the stack--including its status--remains\nunchanged. Enabling or disabling termination protection on a stack sets it for any\nnested stacks belonging to that stack as well. You can enable termination protection\non a stack by setting the `terminationProtection` prop to `true`.\n\n```ts\nconst stack = new Stack(app, 'StackName', {\n  terminationProtection: true,\n});\n```\n\nBy default, termination protection is disabled.\n\n### CfnJson\n\n`CfnJson` allows you to postpone the resolution of a JSON blob from\ndeployment-time. This is useful in cases where the CloudFormation JSON template\ncannot express a certain value.\n\nA common example is to use `CfnJson` in order to render a JSON map which needs\nto use intrinsic functions in keys. Since JSON map keys must be strings, it is\nimpossible to use intrinsics in keys and `CfnJson` can help.\n\nThe following example defines an IAM role which can only be assumed by\nprincipals that are tagged with a specific tag.\n\n```ts\nconst tagParam = new CfnParameter(this, 'TagName');\n\nconst stringEquals = new CfnJson(this, 'ConditionJson', {\n  value: {\n    [`aws:PrincipalTag/${tagParam.valueAsString}`]: true,\n  },\n});\n\nconst principal = new iam.AccountRootPrincipal().withConditions({\n  StringEquals: stringEquals,\n});\n\nnew iam.Role(this, 'MyRole', { assumedBy: principal });\n```\n\n**Explanation**: since in this example we pass the tag name through a parameter, it\ncan only be resolved during deployment. The resolved value can be represented in\nthe template through a `{ \"Ref\": \"TagName\" }`. However, since we want to use\nthis value inside a [`aws:PrincipalTag/TAG-NAME`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principaltag)\nIAM operator, we need it in the *key* of a `StringEquals` condition. JSON keys\n*must be* strings, so to circumvent this limitation, we use `CfnJson`\nto \"delay\" the rendition of this template section to deploy-time. This means\nthat the value of `StringEquals` in the template will be `{ \"Fn::GetAtt\": [ \"ConditionJson\", \"Value\" ] }`, and will only \"expand\" to the operator we synthesized during deployment.\n\n### Stack Resource Limit\n\nWhen deploying to AWS CloudFormation, it needs to keep in check the amount of resources being added inside a Stack. Currently it's possible to check the limits in the [AWS CloudFormation quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html) page.\n\nIt's possible to synthesize the project with more Resources than the allowed (or even reduce the number of Resources).\n\nSet the context key `@aws-cdk/core:stackResourceLimit` with the proper value, being 0 for disable the limit of resources.\n\n<!--END CORE DOCUMENTATION-->\n"

In most\nprogramming languages you will need to write this as `\"\\\\.\"` because the\n`\\` itself will need to be escaped.\n\nFor example,\n```typescript\ncfnResource.addOverride('Properties.GlobalSecondaryIndexes.0.Projection.NonKeyAttributes', ['myattribute']);\ncfnResource.addOverride('Properties.GlobalSecondaryIndexes.1.ProjectionType', 'INCLUDE');\n```\nwould add the overrides\n```json\n\"Properties\": {\n   \"GlobalSecondaryIndexes\": [\n     {\n       \"Projection\": {\n         \"NonKeyAttributes\": [ \"myattribute\" ]\n         ...\n       }\n       ...\n     },\n     {\n       \"ProjectionType\": \"INCLUDE\"\n       ...\n     },\n   ]\n   ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `value` argument to `addOverride` will not be processed or translated\nin any way. Pass raw JSON values in here with the correct capitalization\nfor CloudFormation. If you pass CDK classes or structs, they will be\nrendered with lowercased key names, and CloudFormation will reject the\ntemplate.",

        "remarks": "> For Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling resources, we recommend that you use a `CreationPolicy` attribute instead of wait conditions. Add a CreationPolicy attribute to those resources, and use the cfn-signal helper script to signal when an instance creation process has completed successfully.\n\nYou can use a wait condition for situations like the following:\n\n- To coordinate stack resource creation with configuration actions that are external to the stack creation.\n- To track the status of a configuration process.\n\nFor these situations, we recommend that you associate a [CreationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html) attribute with the wait condition so that you don't have to use a wait condition handle. For more information and an example, see [Creating wait conditions in a template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-waitcondition.html) . If you use a CreationPolicy with a wait condition, don't specify any of the wait condition's properties.\n\n> If you use the [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html) feature, resources in the VPC that respond to wait conditions must have access to CloudFormation , specific Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) buckets. Resources must send wait condition responses to a presigned Amazon S3 URL. If they can't send responses to Amazon S3 , CloudFormation won't receive a response and the stack operation fails.

This can happen in one of three situations:\n\n- The resource is removed from the template, so CloudFormation stops managing it;\n- A change to the resource is made that requires it to be replaced, so CloudFormation stops\n   managing it;\n- The stack is deleted, so CloudFormation stops managing all resources in it.\n\nThe Removal Policy applies to all above cases.\n\nMany stateful resources in the AWS Construct Library will accept a\n`removalPolicy` as a property, typically defaulting it to `RETAIN`.\n\nIf the AWS Construct Library resource does not accept a `removalPolicy`\nargument, you can always configure it by using the escape hatch mechanism,\nas shown in the following example:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const bucket: s3.Bucket;\n\nconst cfnBucket = bucket.node.findChild('Resource') as CfnResource;\ncfnBucket.applyRemovalPolicy(RemovalPolicy.DESTROY);\n```",

Let's say there are two stacks,\n`producerStack` and `consumerStack`, and `producerStack` has a bucket\ncalled `bucket`, which is referenced by `consumerStack` (perhaps because\nan AWS Lambda Function writes into it, or something like that).\n\nIt is not safe to remove `producerStack.bucket` because as the bucket is being\ndeleted, `consumerStack` might still be using it.\n\nInstead, the process takes two deployments:\n\n### Deployment 1: break the relationship\n\n- Make sure `consumerStack` no longer references `bucket.bucketName` (maybe the consumer\n   stack now uses its own bucket, or it writes to an AWS DynamoDB table, or maybe you just\n   remove the Lambda Function altogether).\n- In the `ProducerStack` class, call `this.exportValue(this.bucket.bucketName)`. This\n   will make sure the CloudFormation Export continues to exist while the relationship\n   between the two stacks is being broken.\n- Deploy (this will effectively only change the `consumerStack`, but it's safe to deploy both).\n\n### Deployment 2: remove the bucket resource\n\n- You are now free to remove the `bucket` resource from `producerStack`.\n- Don't forget to remove the `exportValue()` call as well.\n- Deploy again (this time only the `producerStack` will be changed -- the bucket will be deleted).",
