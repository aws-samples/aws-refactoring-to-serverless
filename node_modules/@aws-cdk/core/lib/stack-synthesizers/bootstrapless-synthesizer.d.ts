 * it will re-use the Roles that were created for a different region (which
 * is possible because IAM is a global service).
 *
 * However, it will not assume asset buckets or repositories have been created,
 * and therefore does not support assets.
 *
 * Used by the CodePipeline construct for the support stacks needed for
 * cross-region replication S3 buckets. App builders do not need to use this
 * synthesizer directly.
