Resources that expose metrics will have functions that look\nlike `metricXxx()` which will return a Metric object, initialized with defaults\nthat make sense.\n\nFor example, `lambda.Function` objects have the `fn.metricErrors()` method, which\nrepresents the amount of errors reported by that Lambda function:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\n\nconst errors = fn.metricErrors();\n```\n\n`Metric` objects can be account and region aware. You can specify `account` and `region` as properties of the metric, or use the `metric.attachTo(Construct)` method. `metric.attachTo()` will automatically copy the `region` and `account` fields of the `Construct`, which can come from anywhere in the Construct tree.\n\nYou can also instantiate `Metric` objects to reference any\n[published metric](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html)\nthat's not exposed using a convenience method on the CDK construct.\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nconst hostedZone = new route53.HostedZone(this, 'MyHostedZone', { zoneName: \"example.org\" });\nconst metric = new cloudwatch.Metric({\n  namespace: 'AWS/Route53',\n  metricName: 'DNSQueries',\n  dimensionsMap: {\n    HostedZoneId: hostedZone.hostedZoneId\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Instantiating a new Metric object\n\nIf you want to reference a metric that is not yet exposed by an existing construct,\nyou can instantiate a `Metric` object to represent it. For example:\n\n```ts\nconst metric = new cloudwatch.Metric({\n  namespace: 'MyNamespace',\n  metricName: 'MyMetric',\n  dimensionsMap: {\n    ProcessingStep: 'Download'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Metric Math\n\nMath expressions are supported by instantiating the `MathExpression` class.\nFor example, a math expression that sums two other metrics looks like this:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\n\nconst allProblems = new cloudwatch.MathExpression({\n  expression: \"errors + throttles\",\n  usingMetrics: {\n    errors: fn.metricErrors(),\n    faults: fn.metricThrottles(),\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can use `MathExpression` objects like any other metric, including using\nthem in other math expressions:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\ndeclare const allProblems: cloudwatch.MathExpression;\n\nconst problemPercentage = new cloudwatch.MathExpression({\n  expression: \"(problems / invocations) * 100\",\n  usingMetrics: {\n    problems: allProblems,\n    invocations: fn.metricInvocations()\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Search Expressions\n\nMath expressions also support search expressions. For example, the following\nsearch expression returns all CPUUtilization metrics that it finds, with the\ngraph showing the Average statistic with an aggregation period of 5 minutes:\n\n```ts\nconst cpuUtilization = new cloudwatch.MathExpression({\n  expression: \"SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\\\"CPUUtilization\\\"', 'Average', 300)\",\n\n  // Specifying '' as the label suppresses the default behavior\n  // of using the expression as metric label. This is especially appropriate\n  // when using expressions that return multiple time series (like SEARCH()\n  // or METRICS()), to show the labels of the retrieved metrics only.\n  label: '',\n});\n```\n\nCross-account and cross-region search expressions are also supported. Use\nthe `searchAccount` and `searchRegion` properties to specify the account\nand/or region to evaluate the search expression against.\n\n### Aggregation\n\nTo graph or alarm on metrics you must aggregate them first, using a function\nlike `Average` or a percentile function like `P99`. By default, most Metric objects\nreturned by CDK libraries will be configured as `Average` over `300 seconds` (5 minutes).\nThe exception is if the metric represents a count of discrete events, such as\nfailures. In that case, the Metric object will be configured as `Sum` over `300\nseconds`, i.e. it represents the number of times that event occurred over the\ntime period.\n\nIf you want to change the default aggregation of the Metric object (for example,\nthe function or the period), you can do so by passing additional parameters\nto the metric function call:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\n\nconst minuteErrorRate = fn.metricErrors({\n  statistic: 'avg',\n  period: Duration.minutes(1),\n  label: 'Lambda failure rate'\n});\n```\n\nThis function also allows changing the metric label or color (which will be\nuseful when embedding them in graphs, see below).\n\n> Rates versus Sums\n>\n> The reason for using `Sum` to count discrete events is that *some* events are\n> emitted as either `0` or `1` (for example `Errors` for a Lambda) and some are\n> only emitted as `1` (for example `NumberOfMessagesPublished` for an SNS\n> topic).\n>\n> In case `0`-metrics are emitted, it makes sense to take the `Average` of this\n> metric: the result will be the fraction of errors over all executions.\n>\n> If `0`-metrics are not emitted, the `Average` will always be equal to `1`,\n> and not be very useful.\n>\n> In order to simplify the mental model of `Metric` objects, we default to\n> aggregating using `Sum`, which will be the same for both metrics types. If you\n> happen to know the Metric you want to alarm on makes sense as a rate\n> (`Average`) you can always choose to change the statistic.\n\n### Labels\n\nMetric labels are displayed in the legend of graphs that include the metrics.\n\nYou can use [dynamic labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html)\nto show summary information about the displayed time series\nin the legend. For example, if you use:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\n\nconst minuteErrorRate = fn.metricErrors({\n  statistic: 'sum',\n  period: Duration.hours(1),\n\n  // Show the maximum hourly error count in the legend\n  label: '[max: ${MAX}] Lambda failure rate',\n});\n```\n\nAs the metric label, the maximum value in the visible range will\nbe shown next to the time series name in the graph's legend.\n\nIf the metric is a math expression producing more than one time series, the\nmaximum will be individually calculated and shown for each time series produce\nby the math expression.\n\n## Alarms\n\nAlarms can be created on metrics in one of two ways. Either create an `Alarm`\nobject, passing the `Metric` object to set the alarm on:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\n\nnew cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'Alarm', {\n  metric: fn.metricErrors(),\n  threshold: 100,\n  evaluationPeriods: 2,\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can call `metric.createAlarm()`:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const fn: lambda.Function;\n\nfn.metricErrors().createAlarm(this, 'Alarm', {\n  threshold: 100,\n  evaluationPeriods: 2,\n});\n```\n\nThe most important properties to set while creating an Alarms are:\n\n- `threshold`: the value to compare the metric against.\n- `comparisonOperator`: the comparison operation to use, defaults to `metric >= threshold`.\n- `evaluationPeriods`: how many consecutive periods the metric has to be\n  breaching the the threshold for the alarm to trigger.\n\nTo create a cross-account alarm, make sure you have enabled [cross-account functionality](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html) in CloudWatch. Then, set the `account` property in the `Metric` object either manually or via the `metric.attachTo()` method.\n\n### Alarm Actions\n\nTo add actions to an alarm, use the integration classes from the\n`@aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch-actions` package. For example, to post a message to\nan SNS topic when an alarm breaches, do the following:\n\n```ts\nimport * as cw_actions from '@aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch-actions';\ndeclare const alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm;\n\nconst topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'Topic');\nalarm.addAlarmAction(new cw_actions.SnsAction(topic));\n```\n\n#### Notification formats\n\nAlarms can be created in one of two \"formats\":\n\n- With \"top-level parameters\" (these are the classic style of CloudWatch Alarms).\n- With a list of metrics specifications (these are the modern style of CloudWatch Alarms).\n\nFor backwards compatibility, CDK will try to create classic, top-level CloudWatch alarms\nas much as possible, unless you are using features that cannot be expressed in that format.\nFeatures that require the new-style alarm format are:\n\n- Metric math\n- Cross-account metrics\n- Labels\n\nThe difference between these two does not impact the functionality of the alarm\nin any way, *except* that the format of the notifications the Alarm generates is\ndifferent between them. This affects both the notifications sent out over SNS,\nas well as the EventBridge events generated by this Alarm. If you are writing\ncode to consume these notifications, be sure to handle both formats.\n\n### Composite Alarms\n\n[Composite Alarms](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-cloudwatch-now-allows-you-to-combine-multiple-alarms/)\ncan be created from existing Alarm resources.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const alarm1: cloudwatch.Alarm;\ndeclare const alarm2: cloudwatch.Alarm;\ndeclare const alarm3: cloudwatch.Alarm;\ndeclare const alarm4: cloudwatch.Alarm;\n\nconst alarmRule = cloudwatch.AlarmRule.anyOf(\n  cloudwatch.AlarmRule.allOf(\n    cloudwatch.AlarmRule.anyOf(\n      alarm1,\n      cloudwatch.AlarmRule.fromAlarm(alarm2, cloudwatch.AlarmState.OK),\n      alarm3,\n    ),\n    cloudwatch.AlarmRule.not(cloudwatch.AlarmRule.fromAlarm(alarm4, cloudwatch.AlarmState.INSUFFICIENT_DATA)),\n  ),\n  cloudwatch.AlarmRule.fromBoolean(false),\n);\n\nnew cloudwatch.CompositeAlarm(this, 'MyAwesomeCompositeAlarm', {\n  alarmRule,\n});\n```\n\n### A note on units\n\nIn CloudWatch, Metrics datums are emitted with units, such as `seconds` or\n`bytes`. When `Metric` objects are given a `unit` attribute, it will be used to\n*filter* the stream of metric datums for datums emitted using the same `unit`\nattribute.\n\nIn particular, the `unit` field is *not* used to rescale datums or alarm threshold\nvalues (for example, it cannot be used to specify an alarm threshold in\n*Megabytes* if the metric stream is being emitted as *bytes*).\n\nYou almost certainly don't want to specify the `unit` property when creating\n`Metric` objects (which will retrieve all datums regardless of their unit),\nunless you have very specific requirements. Note that in any case, CloudWatch\nonly supports filtering by `unit` for Alarms, not in Dashboard graphs.\n\nPlease see the following GitHub issue for a discussion on real unit\ncalculations in CDK: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/5595\n\n## Dashboards\n\nDashboards are set of Widgets stored server-side which can be accessed quickly\nfrom the AWS console. Available widgets are graphs of a metric over time, the\ncurrent value of a metric, or a static piece of Markdown which explains what the\ngraphs mean.\n\nThe following widgets are available:\n\n- `GraphWidget` -- shows any number of metrics on both the left and right\n  vertical axes.\n- `AlarmWidget` -- shows the graph and alarm line for a single alarm.\n- `SingleValueWidget` -- shows the current value of a set of metrics.\n- `TextWidget` -- shows some static Markdown.\n- `AlarmStatusWidget` -- shows the status of your alarms in a grid view.\n\n### Graph widget\n\nA graph widget can display any number of metrics on either the `left` or\n`right` vertical axis:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\ndeclare const executionCountMetric: cloudwatch.Metric;\ndeclare const errorCountMetric: cloudwatch.Metric;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({\n  title: \"Executions vs error rate\",\n\n  left: [executionCountMetric],\n\n  right: [errorCountMetric.with({\n    statistic: \"average\",\n    label: \"Error rate\",\n    color: cloudwatch.Color.GREEN,\n  })]\n}));\n```\n\nUsing the methods `addLeftMetric()` and `addRightMetric()` you can add metrics to a graph widget later on.\n\nGraph widgets can also display annotations attached to the left or the right y-axis.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({\n  // ...\n\n  leftAnnotations: [\n    { value: 1800, label: Duration.minutes(30).toHumanString(), color: cloudwatch.Color.RED, },\n    { value: 3600, label: '1 hour', color: '#2ca02c', }\n  ],\n}));\n```\n\nThe graph legend can be adjusted from the default position at bottom of the widget.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({\n  // ...\n\n  legendPosition: cloudwatch.LegendPosition.RIGHT,\n}));\n```\n\nThe graph can publish live data within the last minute that has not been fully aggregated.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({\n  // ...\n\n  liveData: true,\n}));\n```\n\nThe graph view can be changed from default 'timeSeries' to 'bar' or 'pie'.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({\n  // ...\n\n  view: cloudwatch.GraphWidgetView.BAR,\n}));\n```\n\n### Alarm widget\n\nAn alarm widget shows the graph and the alarm line of a single alarm:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\ndeclare const errorAlarm: cloudwatch.Alarm;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.AlarmWidget({\n  title: \"Errors\",\n  alarm: errorAlarm,\n}));\n```\n\n### Single value widget\n\nA single-value widget shows the latest value of a set of metrics (as opposed\nto a graph of the value over time):\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\ndeclare const visitorCount: cloudwatch.Metric;\ndeclare const purchaseCount: cloudwatch.Metric;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.SingleValueWidget({\n  metrics: [visitorCount, purchaseCount],\n}));\n```\n\nShow as many digits as can fit, before rounding.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.SingleValueWidget({\n  metrics: [ /* ... */ ],\n\n  fullPrecision: true,\n}));\n```\n\n### Text widget\n\nA text widget shows an arbitrary piece of MarkDown. Use this to add explanations\nto your dashboard:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.TextWidget({\n  markdown: '# Key Performance Indicators'\n}));\n```\n\n### Alarm Status widget\n\nAn alarm status widget displays instantly the status of any type of alarms and gives the\nability to aggregate one or more alarms together in a small surface.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\ndeclare const errorAlarm: cloudwatch.Alarm;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(\n  new cloudwatch.AlarmStatusWidget({\n    alarms: [errorAlarm],\n  })\n);\n```\n\nAn alarm status widget only showing firing alarms, sorted by state and timestamp:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\ndeclare const errorAlarm: cloudwatch.Alarm;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.AlarmStatusWidget({\n  title: \"Errors\",\n  alarms: [errorAlarm],\n  sortBy: cloudwatch.AlarmStatusWidgetSortBy.STATE_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP,\n  states: [cloudwatch.AlarmState.ALARM],\n}));\n```\n\n### Query results widget\n\nA `LogQueryWidget` shows the results of a query from Logs Insights:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.LogQueryWidget({\n  logGroupNames: ['my-log-group'],\n  view: cloudwatch.LogQueryVisualizationType.TABLE,\n  // The lines will be automatically combined using '\\n|'.\n  queryLines: [\n    'fields @message',\n    'filter @message like /Error/',\n  ]\n}));\n```\n\n### Custom widget\n\nA `CustomWidget` shows the result of an AWS Lambda function:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard;\n\n// Import or create a lambda function\nconst fn = lambda.Function.fromFunctionArn(\n  dashboard,\n  'Function',\n  'arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:MyFn',\n);\n\ndashboard.addWidgets(new cloudwatch.CustomWidget({\n  functionArn: fn.functionArn,\n  title: 'My lambda baked widget',\n}));\n```\n\nYou can learn more about custom widgets in the [Amazon Cloudwatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_custom_widget_dashboard.html).\n\n### Dashboard Layout\n\nThe widgets on a dashboard are visually laid out in a grid that is 24 columns\nwide. Normally you specify X and Y coordinates for the widgets on a Dashboard,\nbut because this is inconvenient to do manually, the library contains a simple\nlayout system to help you lay out your dashboards the way you want them to.\n\nWidgets have a `width` and `height` property, and they will be automatically\nlaid out either horizontally or vertically stacked to fill out the available\nspace.\n\nWidgets are added to a Dashboard by calling `add(widget1, widget2, ...)`.\nWidgets given in the same call will be laid out horizontally. Widgets given\nin different calls will be laid out vertically. To make more complex layouts,\nyou can use the following widgets to pack widgets together in different ways:\n\n- `Column`: stack two or more widgets vertically.\n- `Row`: lay out two or more widgets horizontally.\n- `Spacer`: take up empty space\n"

You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.\n\nCurrently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics.\n\nWhen this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.\n\nWhen you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.",
